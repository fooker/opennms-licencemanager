Licence Manager - project completion

testpage url
http://localhost:8181/pluginmgr/test/licence-mgr-rest-test.html

test page
DONE * create GET buttons for test page and monitor response to get in window at bottom of page
get should include form fields for productId etc
DONE create side window to show response to pressing buttons - presently you need to scroll screen

advanced test page
page - list products installed (product pub / product reg)
page - list licences installed (licence pub / licence reg)

page - licence publisher - create licence for licence metadata page
(1. list licences
(2. load licence metadata for productid
(3. create licence for productid - with form for metadata not just xml
licence manager - install licence for product page

rest interface
DONE make error messages show stack trace of problems in REST error response message - to see why request failed
DONE * create a licence-pub:get / list licence metadata (dont want to get the licence spec just metadata)
DONE * make list responses show full type of response message - to make select / cut paste easier
create renewal time field in licence metadata - to that new licence is created with expiry date = start date + time
look at licence options - change to numbers - and possibly add value constants or range
DONE replace rest interface delete GET with DELETE command/ and or ?confirm=true
check licence metadata includes / does not include licencee info etc
check 400 incorrect reponse from product spec generates an error message not comment

command interface
mirror all commands - 'delete all' commands not mirrored

product installer service
download foreign published product list (url)
list foreign published products
install foreign published products - must install licence first
list installed products (with licence)

changes to licence keys
change licence keys to use ClientKeys/ManagerKeys classes (simplifies understanding of api)
change encryption of licence private key to also use public / private key
change verification of licence to use signature on metadata not encryption of metadata CRC
change to use Base64 instead of hex for encoding (shorter licences)

project completion
* create maven licence generator archetype
add product specific challenge response code for multiple bundle products
create quality pages for licence installation and product listing - possibly with Vaadin
see if project can be seperately licenced - APACHE - possibly pax4j - use with multiple OSGi containers
* add licence headers

allow lazy loading of licence manager / product manager interface ( so project can register product spec if able to)
DONE licence manager shutting down message on removal of manager
DONE *** system property for location of licence file ( for OpenNMS / etc )

proof of concept
